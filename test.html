            I became interested to learn programming when I was entering first
            year college, but then I have doubt because in the first place I
            don't have any background about programming. Through my dedication I
            able to practice and try to learn programming little by little until
            I manage my time to do self-study. I do also practice programming
            through online source code just to enchance my skills and knowledge
            about it. And I was happy beacuse for now I can say that I learned a
            lot since I practice and practice programming since Day 1.

            I love coffee than drinking other drinnks. Like my mother, my day is
            incomplete without cup of coffee. I can drink a cup of Coffee 3
            times a day. I try to taste pure one but Matcha and Macchiato was my
            prepared flavors.
